I'm using Advent of Code to teach myself typescript, and programming/algorithms in general.

Can you help me think through implementation and solving of these problems? My goals are:
- Write idiomatic, modern typescript
- Let's stick to the standard library.. I don't imagine any of these problems require external packages.
- Come up with efficient solutions, within reason (no drop down to any extraneous lower-level systems, if that's even possible in TS/JS).

Instructions:
- Please help me reason through implementation without giving me too many details. I want to feel like I've come up with the work myself.
- Feel free to highlight standard library functions and data structures once I've figured out that I need to use them... I don't know any/much TS so that is helping me learn.
- You can ward me off of over complicating things.
- Typically I imagine I'll start off with the simplest solution then look to optimize it.
- If my code has a mistake and I haven't explicitly told you there's a mistake, don't point it out to me please.
